make participation in this project a respectful, professional, and harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind,
- dismissive, demeaning, or hostile comments toward contributors or their work,

  professional technical setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers and designated leaders are responsible for clarifying and
enforcing standards of acceptable behaviour.

They may take appropriate and proportionate corrective action in response to any
behaviour deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, misleading, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, pull requests, discussions, or other contributions that do not align with
this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when
appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Eisengrau-managed spaces, including:
- the GitHub repository,
- pull requests, issues, and code reviews,
- GitHub Discussions,
- and any other official communication channels associated with the project.

It also applies when an individual is officially representing Eisengrau in public
spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported
privately to the project maintainers.
