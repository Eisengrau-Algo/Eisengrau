# Contributing to Eisengrau

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Eisengrau**.

This repository is a long-term, pedagogy-first knowledge base for algorithmic
problem solving. Contributions are welcome, provided they align with the
project’s goals of clarity, rigor, and transferable understanding.

---

## What This Repository Values

Eisengrau prioritises:
- **algorithmic reasoning over submission results**,  
- **clear explanation over minimal code**,  
- **transferable patterns over one-off tricks**,  
- **correctness and insight over cleverness**.

Contributions should aim to *teach* something reusable.

---

## What You Can Contribute

You are welcome to contribute:
- new problems and solutions,
- alternative solution approaches,
- optimisations or generalisations,
- explanatory notes or proofs,
- clarifications of common pitfalls,
- improvements to organisation or documentation.

Both beginner-friendly and advanced material are welcome, provided it is
clearly framed.

---

## Where to Place Content

Content should be placed according to the **dominant algorithmic idea** it
illustrates.

When deciding where something belongs, ask:
- Which paradigm is essential to the solution?
- What concept should a reader recognise and reuse?
- If teaching this problem, which idea is central?

Avoid duplicating the same problem across multiple folders.
If a problem admits multiple paradigms, document alternative approaches
within the same directory.

If you are unsure where something fits, open an issue or discussion first.

---

## Problem Directory Structure

A typical problem directory may include:
- one or more implementations (different approaches or trade-offs),
- a `README.md` explaining the reasoning and constraints,
- notes on complexity and limitations.

Not every contribution needs to follow the same format rigidly.
Clarity and instructional value take precedence.

---

## Code and Explanation Guidelines

When contributing code:
- prioritise readability over brevity,
- avoid unnecessary micro-optimisations unless they are the point,
- include comments where reasoning is non-obvious.

When contributing explanations:
- explain *why* an approach works,
- highlight trade-offs between alternatives,
- note common mistakes or misleading intuitions.

---

## Attribution and Authorship

Eisengrau is a multi-author repository.

If you contribute:
- you retain authorship of your contributions,
- your name may be listed in file headers or documentation where appropriate,
- your contribution will be distributed under the repository’s license.

When adapting or extending existing material:

  with proper attribution.

If you are unsure whether material you are contributing is compatible with
this license, do not submit it without clarification.

## Academic Integrity

If you are a student:
- ensure that your contributions comply with your institution’s academic
  integrity policies,
- do not submit assessed coursework or restricted material.

This repository is intended for learning and teaching, not for violating
assessment rules.

## How to Contribute

Typical contribution flow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Add your contribution following the existing structure.

## Final Note

Eisengrau is designed to grow **slowly, thoughtfully, and coherently**.

If your contribution improves understanding, clarity, or long-term value,
it is welcome.

Thank you for helping build a rigorous and shared resource for algorithmic
thinking.
